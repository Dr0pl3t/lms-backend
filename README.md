# lms-backend
Demo project for Spring Boot Library Management System.

Currently implemented a REST API with basic CRUD operations on a Book entity, designed for managing a personal or library book list.

Planned: 
1. Author Entity
2. Bi-directional One-to-Many relationship where one Author can write many Books, but each Book is written by one Author
3. Employee/Customer Account + RBAC
